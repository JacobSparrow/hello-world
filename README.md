hello-world
===========

Good morning. It is Thursday, October 23, 2014. 

Today is the first day of the rest of my life. It is the day that
I bury perfectionism and do what is important liberated from fear.

I am learning Visual Studio .NET and Git for version control.

Every pre-dawn morning you will find me here coding the hell out of something.

I am not interested in where I am going or where I have been.

For the first time in my life I am having fun.
